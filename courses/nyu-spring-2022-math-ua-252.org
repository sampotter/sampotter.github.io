** Description

   This is an introductory course in numerical analysis. Topics
   include: the solution of linear and nonlinear equations,
   conditioning, least squares, numerical computation of eigenvalues,
   interpolation, and quadrature. The focus is on the analysis and
   implementation of numerical methods.

*** Materials

   Readings will be posted in the schedule below. All material will be
   accessible either through this website or NYU. You do not need to
   purchase a textbook for this course.

*** Homework

   There will be written assignments and programming assignments.

   Written assignments will consist of short theoretical exercises
   (proofs) which must be prepared using LaTeX.

   Programming assignments will be done using Python along with the
   numpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages.

*** Scribing

One person will scribe each class, and each person will be
required to scribe at least once. This will count towards 5% of
your grade. The scribed notes will be compiled into a shared
Overleaf document for you all to use.

[[https://www.overleaf.com/project/61eb071a35c3d0197d662200][Link to the scribed lecture notes on Overleaf]] (requires access).

Here's our current "scribing workflow":
1. write notes by hand (or whatever is most comfortable for you) during class
2. after class, re-write them using LaTeX however you prefer (this can be directly in Overleaf or locally on your computer)
3. send me the .tex file or share the Overleaf document
4. I will edit them lightly and send them back to you for you to make sure I didn't screw them up :-)
5. I will merge them into the shared notes

When it comes to scribing, here are a few important things to remember:

1. 30 other people will have to read your notes => they must be understandable
2. you must include written words to ease the exposition
3. you must use LaTeX to typeset the notes properly
4. you must include the majority of the content of the lecture

To achieve this, we will go back and forth and edit your notes until I deem them acceptable. Only then will you receive credit for scribing. My goal: you are thoughtful about the process and put effort into it. Please be conscientious and consider your classmates.

3. Overleaf has a ton of great LaTeX resources---just look at the list of guides on the left-hand side of the previous two pages. In general, if you are stuck on how to do something in LaTeX, try searching Overleaf's docs, or just ask me.
