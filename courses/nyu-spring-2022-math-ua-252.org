** Course description

** Course materials

   Readings for each section will be assigned and will be a mixture
   of sections from textbooks and short papers. All material will
   be accessible either through this website or NYU. You do not
   need to purchase a textbook for this course.

** Scribing

   A different person will scribe each week. Everyone in the class
   must scribe at least once. Scribing involves taking careful
   notes during the lecture, typesetting them using LaTeX, and
   sending them to me so that I can merge them into a set of course
   notes which will be available on a shared Overleaf document.

** Homework

   Homework will be posted here as it is made available. It will
   consist of a mix of written assignments and short programming
   assignments. Written assignments must be prepared using LaTeX.

** Programming

   All of the programming assignments will be done using Python
   along with the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages (and no
   others).
